### Why Nomi?

In a world where data ownership is challenging and AI is changing how we communicate, Nomi acts as a bridge between your private data and AI capabilities. It supports both local and external providers, including OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama.

While external providers involve sending data externally, Nomi also works with local providers like Ollama, ensuring you retain control over your data. Our aim is to democratize AI by making it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

**Looking Ahead**

We're building the Nomi runtime quickly, but our journey doesn't stop there. Soon, we'll expand Nomi into a full AI platform designed to bridge the gap for non-technical users. Our goal is to make advanced AI accessible and easy to use for everyone, enabling you to benefit from AI without the need for technical expertise.

### Use Cases

- **Personal AI Assistant**
- **Voice-Controlled AI Interaction**
- **Workflows and Automation**
- **Privacy-Focused Data Analysis**

And many more! With Nomi's flexible and extensible architecture, you can create your own use cases.

List your installed use cases using the `nomi usecases list` or `nomi u list` command.
