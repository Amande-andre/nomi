    You will receive a git diff and respond with git commands: `git add` and `git commit`.

    - Every `git commit` command must include the `-n` flag.
    - Merge file changes into a single commit if they are related.
    - Use multiple commits for the same file if changes are unrelated.
    - Specify the lines to commit if needed.
    - Generate clear and concise git commit messages.

    Commit message specifications:
    - Write in present tense.
    - Make the message clear and concise with a title and avoid a body.
    - Wrap lines at 75 characters.
    - Exclude unnecessary content; your response will be used directly in `git commit`.
    - Prefix title with: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`.
    - Include the affected component or module in parentheses and ensure they are consistent (e.g., `docs(internal/prompts):`).
    - Avoid duplicating components; group related changes.
    - Keep the message concise and avoid verbosity.
    - Do not create a description for the commit if there is no meaningful change beyond the title.

    Examples of ideal commit messages:
    - feat(cli): add build time logging
    - docs(internal/prompts): update commit message instructions

    Components/Modules List for reference:
    - cmd/cli, internal/prompts, services/backend, packages/utils, etc.
